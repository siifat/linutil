# Bug Fixes - Round 3

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Back Button (Escape Key) Not Working

**Problem**: 
Pressing `Escape` did nothing on any screen except welcome screen.

**Root Cause**:
Textual's keybindings `Binding("escape", "pop_screen", "Back")` looks for a method called `action_pop_screen()`. We defined the binding but forgot to implement the method.

**Solution**:
Added `action_pop_screen()` method to all screens:

```python
def action_pop_screen(self) -> None:
    """Go back to previous screen."""
    self.app.pop_screen()
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/linutil/ui/app.py` - Added to `UpdateScreen`
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/apps_screen.py` - Added to `AppsScreen`
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/tweaks_screen.py` - Added to `TweaksScreen`

**Now Works**:
- Press `Escape` from any screen ‚Üí Returns to previous screen
- Press `Q` from any screen ‚Üí Quits application

### 2. ‚úÖ Container Content Cut Off at Bottom

**Problem**: 
In the "Install Applications" and "System Tweaks" screens, content was cut off at the bottom. For example, in the Utilities section with 3 apps, only 1 app was visible even after scrolling.

**Root Cause**:
The ScrollableContainer had a fixed `height: 30;` which wasn't tall enough to show all content, especially on smaller terminals or when there are many items.

**Solution**:
Changed the CSS for both containers:

**Before**:
```css
#apps-container {
    height: 30;
    border: solid $primary;
    padding: 1;
    margin: 1 0;
}
```

**After**:
```css
#apps-container {
    height: 100%;
    max-height: 40;
    border: solid $primary;
    padding: 1;
    margin: 1 0;
}
```

This allows the container to:
- Take up full available height (`height: 100%`)
- Cap at 40 lines maximum (`max-height: 40`)
- Scroll properly when content exceeds the height

**Files Modified**:
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/apps_screen.py` - `#apps-container` CSS
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/tweaks_screen.py` - `#tweaks-container` CSS

**Now Works**:
- All apps/tweaks are visible
- Scrolling works properly with arrow keys
- Bottom border is always visible

### 3. ‚úÖ No Selection Count Display

**Problem**: 
Users couldn't see how many apps/tweaks they had selected before installing/applying.

**Solution**:
Added a notification that shows the count and names of selected items before proceeding to the confirmation screen:

```python
app_names = [app.name for app in selected]
self.app.notify(
    f"Selected {len(selected)} application(s): {', '.join(app_names[:3])}{'...' if len(app_names) > 3 else ''}",
    severity="information",
    timeout=3
)
```

**Behavior**:
- Shows count: "Selected 3 application(s)"
- Shows first 3 names: "Firefox, Git, htop"
- If more than 3, adds "..." at the end
- Notification appears for 3 seconds before terminal suspension

**Files Modified**:
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/apps_screen.py` - Added to `action_install()`
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/tweaks_screen.py` - Added to `action_apply()`

**Example Output**:
```
Selected 2 application(s): Firefox, Git
Selected 5 tweak(s): RPM Fusion, Codecs, DNF Optimization...
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Wrong Notification on Cancel

**Problem**: 
When user pressed `N` to cancel an operation, the app would still show a positive/error notification like "Installation completed successfully!" or just generic "failed or cancelled" error message.

**Root Cause**:
Two issues:
1. `terminal_executor.py` returned success code (0) when user cancelled
2. Notification messages used error severity for cancellation

**Solution**:

**Part 1: Fixed Terminal Executor**
Changed cancellation return code from 0 (success) to 1 (error):

```python
# Before
if response not in ['y', 'yes']:
    print("Operation cancelled.")
    return TerminalResult.from_code(0)  # Wrong! This means success

# After
if response not in ['y', 'yes']:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
    return TerminalResult.from_code(1)  # Correct! This means failure/cancel
```

**Part 2: Improved Notification Messages**
Distinguish between cancellation (warning) and actual failure (error):

```python
if result.success:
    self.app.notify("Installation completed successfully!", severity="information")
else:
    # User cancelled or command failed
    if result.return_code == 130:  # Ctrl+C
        msg = "Installation cancelled (Ctrl+C)"
    else:
        msg = "Installation cancelled or failed"
    self.app.notify(msg, severity="warning")  # Warning, not error
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/linutil/core/terminal_executor.py` - Changed return code 0‚Üí1 for cancellation
- `src/linutil/ui/app.py` - Improved UpdateScreen notification
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/apps_screen.py` - Improved AppsScreen notification
- `src/linutil/ui/screens/tweaks_screen.py` - Improved TweaksScreen notification

**Now Shows**:
- ‚úÖ Success ‚Üí Green/Information notification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User cancels with `N` ‚Üí Yellow/Warning notification: "cancelled or failed"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User presses Ctrl+C ‚Üí Yellow/Warning notification: "cancelled (Ctrl+C)"
- ‚ùå Actual command failure ‚Üí Same warning (commands show error in terminal)
